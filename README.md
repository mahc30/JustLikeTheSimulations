# JustLikeTheSimulations

The principal idea of this _torturen't_ is to hopefully one day do something cool
and visual and everything with colors **Woosh** and practice some math and programming
and don't die of boredom etc. 

*By the time i'm writing this i know nothing about what i should be using other than*
*i'm gonna do some P5js.*

To introduce me to this _dien't_ i will use the video 
[**"CodingChallenge #86: Cube Wave by Bees and Bombs"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H81Tdrmz2LA) by [**The Coding Train**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw)

Expectations for this: First i'm going to literally end up with a copy paste of his code
but i can play with that later.

Alright i guess it went ok, i added some sliders to change colors because yeah people like colors, probably going to look back at it in the future to add a some *features* but i will leave it how it is at the moment and move forward

My plan for this night is make just a ball that moves from left to right and then right to left **Be amazed**. You weren't thinking Â¿Did you just make this amazing simulation with colors and moving things in **3D** and now you're just going to make a simple moving ball?

The reason is that i'll be doing this by myself, me, only me and myself with help of myself *and the documentation of p5 and a ridiculous amount of stack overflow probably*

So i just did it after probably 30 mins, better than i expected... when i was looking for how to make a circumference i found that CodingTrain-San has done this before but it's ok... I will act as i didn't know that to feel more original.

**News** I made it bounce because that would be nice to practice some physics too, i will think in *features* to add later.

I'm seeing it today and aw it look's beautiful <3
k the the plan for today is... make it interactive, like, they float away from mouse, or change color when clicked or something, i'll see.

As i start adding things i start to think that it would be easier to work with a circle object, but i'm already too deep into this, it would be like starting again. This could be an actual fun game lol.
