The principal idea of this _torturen't_ is to hopefully one day do something cool

*By the time i'm writing this i know nothing about what i should be using other than*
*i'm gonna do some P5js.*

To introduce me to this _dien't_ i will use the video 
**"CodingChallenge #86: Cube Wave by Bees and Bombs"** by **The Coding Train**

**DON'T FORGET TO ADD LINK LATER** <--- My Comments>

Expectations for this: First i'm going to literally end up with a copy paste of his code
